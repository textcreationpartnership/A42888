         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

about nine of the clock in the forenoon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Munday,</hi> he (going hence to <hi>Ogburn,</hi> Sr.
<hi>Andrew</hi> in the ſame County, to one <hi>Iohn
Hawks</hi> in the ſame place, Husbandman, with a piece of ſerge,
which he had woven for the ſaid <hi>Iohn Howks</hi>) at a Stile neer
<hi>Godres</hi> grounds in <hi>Ogburn,</hi> neer the High-way, there he
ſaw the perfect apparition of <hi>Edward Aven,</hi> late of this town
<hi>Glover</hi> (with whoſe Daughter this relatant married) in the
ſhape of the ſame Cloaths, Hat, Shooes, and Stockings, that
he uſually wote whiles he lived; who to this Relatants own
knowledge dyed at <hi>Collingborn-Kingſton,</hi> in this County, on

others of his relations, brought thence, and buried here in St.
<hi>Mary's</hi> Church-yard, the next day, <hi>viz.</hi> the twelfth Day of
<hi>May;</hi> and he ſaith, that the Apparition to his ſeeming, leaned
over a ſtile; and, when he was come near the ſaid ſtile, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
did ſpeak with an audable voice theſe words, <hi>viz.
Are you afraid?</hi> To which the relatant anſwered, I am think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one who is dead and buried, which you are like to: to
which the Apparition anſwered with the like voice of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Aven,</hi> I am he that you was thinking of, I am <hi>Edward
Aven,</hi> your Father-in-Law, come near to me, and I will do
you no harm, and this relatant replied, <hi>viz.</hi> I truſt in him,
who hath bought my ſoul with his precious blood, you ſhall
do me no harm, and the apparition ſaid; How ſtands caſes at
home, and the relatant ſaid, what caſes? and the apparition
<pb facs="tcp:107662:3"/>
ſaid, How do <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> meaning this relatants Wife
and her Brother, which is the ſaid <hi>Avens</hi> Son and Daughter,
then the Apparition ſaid, What? Taylor is dead, meaning as
this relatant ſuppoſed, one <hi>Iohn Taylor</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Shooma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
who had maried <hi>Sarah</hi> another of the ſaid <hi>Avens</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which ſaid <hi>Taylor</hi> as this relatant hath heard, dyed about
<hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt paſt; Then the Apparition held out his hand,
and in it as this relatant ſuppoſed money about twenty or 30
ſhillings in ſilver, and it ſaid, with the like audable voice, take
this mony and ſend it <hi>Sarah,</hi> for I ſhut up my bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
towards her in the time of my life, and now here is
ſome money for her, and further ſaid, Mary <hi>is troubled for me,
but tell her that God hath ſhewed mercy to me beyond my deſarts,</hi>
and this relatant ſaid, upon offering of the ſaid money to
him, he replyed to the ſaid Apparition; In the name of Jeſus
Chriſt I refuſe all ſuch moneys. Then it ſpoke theſe words; <hi>I
perceive you are afraid, I will meet you ſome other time,</hi> then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
as this relatant perceived it went up the Lane;
whereupon this relatant went over the ſtile as aforeſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in much fear, and for that time ſaw him no more: And
this relatant further ſaith, that he being at work at his Loom
in his own houſe about ſeven a clock in the Evening of the
ſame Day the ſaid Apparation lift up the lid of his window,
and finding it to be the ſame apparition that he had met the
ſame Day at <hi>Ogborn</hi> ſtile as aforeſaid being in much fear, run
out of his ſhop, and ſaw no more of it that night, but ſaith;
that the next night after this relatant went forth into his back
ſide about the ſame hour with a candle in his hand to make
water, and as he was ſo doing the like Apparation came
round his Wood houſe, and this relatant alſo being in a fear
and his Candle waxing out, he run into his houſe, and ſaid he
ſaw it no more that night, but ſaith further, that on <hi>Thurſday</hi>

homeward from Sir <hi>Bolſtrock VVhitelocks</hi> houſe, in <hi>Chilton</hi>
Lodge in this County about 3 or 4 a clock in the Afternoon
in the bottom neer <hi>Ramsberry</hi> Manner-houſe, as he was rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the hill there to his apprehenſion he ſaw a Hare
running out of the old Park, there a thwart in the highway in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Cops, at which the relatants horſe afrighted, and rared
on his hinder legs, overthrew into the dirt, and as ſoon as he
could recover on his legs, he ſaw the like apparition ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about 8 foot from him, directly in the way before him, &amp;
ſaid with the like voice. Thomas <hi>you have tarried long,</hi> and
then ſaid to this relatant, <hi>Thomas bid</hi> Will Aven <hi>take the
ſword that he had of me which is now in his houſe, and carry it to
the wood as we go to</hi> Alton <hi>to the upper end of the wood, which
lyeth by the Way ſide, for with that ſword I did wrong above</hi> 30
<hi>years ago, and he never proſpered ſince he has had the ſword, and
bid</hi> Will Aven <hi>give his Siſter</hi> Sarah 20 <hi>ſhillings of the money
which he had of me, and do you talk with</hi> Edward Laurence, <hi>for
I borrowed 20 ſhillings of him ſeveral years ago, and did ſay that
I had payd him it when I did not pay it him, and I cannot be at
reſt till the 20s. be paid, and I would deſire you to pay him the
20s. out of the money which you had of</hi> James Elliot <hi>at 2 pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
Which money he this relatant affirmeth was 5 Pound,

laſt at a payments, <hi>viz,</hi> 35 ſhillings at one time, &amp; 35
ſhillings at another, and then the Apparition further ſaid to
this relatant. Tell <hi>Margret,</hi> meaning as this relatant confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it might be, the ſaid Avens <hi>wife, that</hi> I <hi>would deſire her to
deliver the Kettel which</hi> I <hi>gave to little</hi> Sarah Taylor <hi>to the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
child, or to anyone that ſhe will intruſt for it, but if ſhe will not
ſpeak to</hi> Edward Laurence <hi>to perſwade her, but if ſhe will not,

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107662:4"/>
within twelve months and a day after my Death, and peace be with
you;</hi> and ſo it went away over the rail into the Wood there,
as any man may go over a ſtile, to this relatant's apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and ſo this relatant ſaw it no more at that time; &amp; this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latant
further ſaith, that accordingly he has paid the ſaid <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Lawrence</hi> the 20s. who alſo was here preſent, affirmeth,
that he had lent the ſaid <hi>Aven</hi> 20 s. above 20 y. ago, and that
none knew thereof but the ſaid <hi>Lawrence</hi> and his Wife; and
the ſaid <hi>Aven</hi> and his Wife; and this relatant further ſaith,
that the laſt night he making relation of the ſaid Apparition
and paſſages unto <hi>Chriſtopher Lipperd</hi> now Mayjor of this
Town and others he was adviſed by them to order <hi>VVilliam
Aven</hi> to carry the ſaid ſword to the ſaid <hi>Copps</hi> neer <hi>Alton,</hi> &amp;
that this relatant ſhould go with him thither; whereupon the
relatant &amp; the ſaid <hi>Aven</hi> did reſolve to go as on Tueſday
following, which was on the morrow, and ſaith, that he this
relatant and his Brother-in-law, as he affirmeth, were both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much troubled in mind to ſee, that they could not ſleep
until they were both reſolved to carry the ſword to the ſaid
<hi>Copps</hi> on that day; and accordingly both did, and ſaith; that
both of them comming to the ſaid <hi>Cops</hi> about 9 of the clock
in the morning, the ſaid <hi>VVilliam Aven</hi> took the ſword, and
laid it down neer the place, as this relatant was directed by
the ſaid Apparition; and both of them turning about to come
away from thence, this relatant looking back ſaw the Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in like habit of cloth as aforeſaid; which when this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
diſcovered, he ſaid to his brother-in-Law, <hi>Here is the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
of Father;</hi> but he ſaid, I <hi>ſee it not;</hi> ſo this relatant falling
on his knees, praying to God to preſerve them both, asking
his ſaid Brother-in-law, whether he did ſee it, who ſaid, <hi>No;</hi>
and then he ſaid, <hi>Lord open his eyes that he may ſee it;</hi> who then
replyed, <hi>Lord grant that</hi> I <hi>may not ſee it if it be thy bleſſed will;</hi>
&amp; then the Apparition beckned his hand to him to come to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107662:4"/>
it, &amp; this relatant then ſaid, <hi>In the name of the Father, Sn, and
Holy Ghoſt what would you have me to do?</hi> and the Apparition
ſaid to this relatant. Thomas, <hi>take up the ſword and follow me,</hi>
&amp; this relatant ſaid, <hi>Should both of us come, or one of us,</hi> to which
it ſaid, Thomas <hi>do you take up the Sword;</hi> ſo this relatant took
up the ſword, &amp; the Apparition went on before him further
into the <hi>Copps-</hi>Wood about 20 lugs; &amp; this relatant then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
it, the Apparition turning back, he this relatant ſtood
about a lug and a half from it, his ſaid brother ſtanding neer
the place, where he firſt laid down the ſword, &amp; this relatant
laid down the ſword upon the ground, &amp; ſaw ſomething like
a Maſtiff-Dog of a brown colour, and the Apparition wav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards this relatant, he ſtepped back about 3 ſteps, &amp;
the Apparition ſaid, <hi>Do not be afraid</hi> Thomas, <hi>for</hi> I <hi>have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
for to reveal things unto thee, but have a Commiſſion not
to touch you;</hi> &amp; when it had taken up the ſword, &amp; went back
to the place, at which before it ſtood, when this relatant ſaw
the Maſtiff-Dog which as before, the Apparition pointed
the top of the ſword into the ground, &amp; ſaid, <hi>In this place ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
buried the bones of him that</hi> I <hi>murthered in the year 1635.
which are now rotten and turned unto duſt,</hi> Whereupon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latant
ſaid, I adjure in the name of the Father, Son, &amp; Holy
